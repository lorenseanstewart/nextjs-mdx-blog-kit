# Next.js MDX Blog Kit

**Feature List:**

-   Static website deployment
-   Write your posts in markdown, and use React components in your markdown thanks to [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx). Or use plain React, if you prefer.
-   A CLI for creating new pages or posts. It processes all the necessary meta data for creating the blog list and adding SEO data to all pages.
-   Close to perfect Lighthouse scores. The lowest score is 99% for Performance, a 1% drop due to loading and displaying a custom font (Abril Fatface).
-   Excellent SEO
-   Service Worker that caches all pages and posts for offline reading
-   Tag search
-   A [reading progress indicator](https://github.com/jeremenichelli/scrollProgress) on posts (optional/configurable)
-   [Code syntax highlighting](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter)
-   [Smooth scroll links](https://github.com/mauricevancooten/react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll)
-   [Optimized images](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images)
